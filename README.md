# Accessing Rocket via an SSH connection from outside the university
1. Get access to an SSH client or a unix terminal. Examples are available below.
   * There is an SSH client in RAS `https://services.ncl.ac.uk/itservice/core-services/software/ras/`
   * Linux Subsystem for Windows has a terminal which is capable of supporting SSH `https://www.illuminiastudios.com/dev-diaries/ssh-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux/`
   * Almost all Linux distributions come with SSH built in.
1. Launch the client/terminal and enter the following, replacing `username` with your Newcastle University username.
   ```
   ssh username@unix.ncl.ac.uk
   ```
   This brings you into AIDAN, Newcastle University's SSH server.
3. From Aidan, SSH into Rocket.
   ```
   ssh username@rocket.hpc.ncl.ac.uk
   ```
